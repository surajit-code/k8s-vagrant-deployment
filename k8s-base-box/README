Instructions are for ceating a base box on libvirt on CentOS 7 host

  Make sure libvirt/kvm installed and running on libvirt
  systemctl status libvirtd
  To install on CentOS7 you can use:
  yum install qemu-kvm libvirt libvirt-python libguestfs-tools virt-install

  Vagrant installtion:
    wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.10/vagrant_2.2.10_x86_64.rpm
    rpm -Uvh vagrant_2.2.10_x86_64.rpm
  On CentOS and Ubuntu, rsysnc will need to be installed
    yum install rsync

  vagrant plugins requirement
    On CentOS 7
      Plugin install prerequisite on CentOS7
        yum install gcc libvirt libvirt-devel libxml2-devel make ruby-devel
      Plugin installtion
        vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
        vagrant plugin install vagrant-mutate

Prepare storage pool for libvirt:
  Vagrant uses pool name default for VM images
  Verify if it exists like so:
  virsh pool-list --all | grep default
  If it is active you are good

  If not find a partition with about 45G of free space
  And create a pool as below. For my example it was /home/

    mkdir -p /home/vagrant-images

    virsh pool-define /dev/stdin <<EOF
<pool type='dir'>
  <name>default</name>
  <target>
    <path>/home/vagrant-images</path>
  </target>
</pool>
EOF

    virsh pool-start default
    virsh pool-autostart default

Certain firewall rules may prevent Vagrant from
allocating IP to VMs
  For this either figure out the offending rule
  and allow that port to communicate

  Or, flush filter table rules at your own risk
  to flush filter rules with just iptables, run
  iptables -F
  If firewall is managed by firewalld, to
  flush run
  systemctl stop firewalld

Base box creation

cd to directory k8s-base-box
run the following in order
  vagrant up --provider=libvirt #on KVM
  vagrant up --provider=virtualbox #on VirtualBox
  vagrant box list
  export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=direct
  vagrant package --output Cent7K8sBase.box
  vagrant box add Cent7K8sBase.box --name Cent7K8sBase
  vagrant box list
